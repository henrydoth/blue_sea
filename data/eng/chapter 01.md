**Chapter One**

One July afternoon, I fled the stifling heat of home — a Japanese-style garden bungalow — with only a pencil and notebook in hand. Every summer, the house turned into an unbearable oven.

Riding my newly bought bicycle, I let the evening breeze blow against my face, breathing in the fragrance of unknown wildflowers along the way. I watched flocks of birds returning to their nests, smoke spiraling from distant chimneys, and finally stopped at the edge of the boundless blue sea. I was a child who loved the ocean. As long as I stood by the sea, with my bare feet sinking into soft sand and the waves circling around them, a quiet joy and peace would well up inside me for no reason. Only by the sea did I feel like I could always remain a little girl, free to dream endlessly…

A few seabirds circled low, crying mournfully. I watched, entranced, inexplicably moved. Were they lost children, separated from their flock? Searching for their mother? Searching for home?
"Home"—such a warm, sweet place.

Raised in love and protection since childhood, I couldn’t imagine how bleak life would be without a home to belong to, a shelter to return to.

I opened my notebook and gently wrote the word “home.” I decided to write a children’s story about a lost seabird finding its way back over a thousand miles. I had started writing simple children’s stories in the newspaper when I was seventeen. The column was titled **"For Little Tong,"** named after my niece who had just turned one at the time — and it had been six years now. Though it was only a small local paper, and though Little Tong had only recently learned to read, just seeing the unchanged words "For Little Tong" on that column for six years gave me an inexhaustible strength.

When inspiration strikes, I fear I won’t be able to catch up with it. Just as I was writing with great focus, I suddenly heard a child's voice in the distance:

“Little Auntie! Little Auntie—!”

Startled, I instinctively gripped my pencil tighter. Impossible — I was just thinking about him, and he really came? I turned around. The beach glowed gold under the setting sun, and I could vaguely make out a few jumping figures. I stood up quickly and immediately recognized the fastest runner, the loudest voice — it was Little Tong! I ran forward, smiling, trying to lift him up, but he was too heavy now.

“Ow!” I laughed, kissing his sweat-drenched cheek. “Little Tong’s grown again!”

He clung to my neck and cried out:

“Little Auntie! I missed you so much! Why don’t you come to my house anymore?”

I laughed, tousling his dense short hair, and said:

“Because I’ve been busy writing stories for Little Tong to read!”

“I don’t want stories, I just want to see Little Auntie!”

“Ha ha ha!” I laughed and pinched his cheek. “Your sweet little mouth is getting even sweeter! Have you been a good boy? Listened to your parents?”

He nodded.

“I’m very good! I listen! But… it’s no use!”

Puzzled, I looked at him. His smile disappeared, replaced by a grim seriousness that didn’t belong to a child.

“Daddy and Mommy still fight every day. They’re getting a divorce—”

I froze, speechless. My eldest sister came over holding Xuexue’s hand. Xuexue broke free and ran toward me. I caught her — she was as light and soft as snow. Her pure, wide eyes blinked as she stared up at me. I brushed the fine hair from her pink cheek and asked with a smile:

“Xuexue, who am I?”

“Little Auntie!” she said sweetly in her soft child’s voice, like melting honey.

I put her down and watched as Little Tong took off his shoes and socks, then struggled to help three-and-a-half-year-old Xuexue take hers off. Only then did I look up at my sister. She was still elegantly dressed, but no amount of makeup could hide the fatigue and weariness on her face.

“What brings you here?” I asked, noticing Xiao Yiheng standing nearby with a smile.

“Brother Xiao! You’re here too?”

Xiao Yiheng stepped closer and said:

“I came to your house, and just as I arrived, Biying and the kids showed up too. Since you weren’t home, I figured you might be here, so I brought them along. Good thing you really were here — otherwise, I’d have failed my mission.”

I thanked him with a smile, still slightly embarrassed thinking about the awkward incident that happened here last year. The three of us sat together. Little Tong was leading Xuexue into the shallow water, and my sister called out loudly:

“Come back, you two!”

“I’ll be careful!” Little Tong pleaded, looking at me for help.

“Let him go,” I said. “We’re all here anyway.”

The two children happily played and laughed in the shallow water. My sister turned her gaze back and bit her lip.

“We’ve decided to divorce.”

I looked up and met Xiao Yiheng’s eyes. We both turned our attention to my sister. She tried to appear lighthearted but could only muster a desolate smile.

“Surprised? We’re signing next week.”

“Little Tong already told me,” I said, a bit resentful. Why had they let the child know? My sister looked surprised and sighed.

“Maybe it’s better this way. He would’ve found out sooner or later—”

“You fought again?” I interrupted coldly, with an edge of harshness.

“Fighting won’t solve anything anymore. We can’t even talk to each other — divorce is the only way!”

“How strange. All those sweet promises, vows of eternal love… were they all lies?”

“Hmph.” My sister sneered and gritted her teeth. “Not worth a damn.”

I shuddered. The once elegant, gentle Luo Biying had really been worn down by marriage — thin, listless, disheveled, and at times even coarse. I felt pity for her.

“Big Sis… can’t you try again?”

“Try again? It’s been two years! You know this better than anyone. He doesn’t even want to come to our house anymore! Even as just an observer, you couldn’t stand it. How do you think I feel, living it?”

“But think of the children…”

“The children! That’s why we held out this long. I want the children. I must have them!”

“Will he give them to you?”

She shook her head repeatedly.

“He knows the kids are my weak spot. He’ll only divorce me if I give them to him. He said he’d give me money but not the children. He knows I don’t care about money—”

Then both my sister and I turned our gaze toward the silent Xiao Yiheng. He spoke, somewhat awkwardly:

“According to civil law, after a divorce, unless otherwise agreed, custody goes to the father—”

“I’ve already consulted a lawyer…” my sister said, disappointed again.

“I think… brother-in-law doesn’t actually want a divorce,” I said.

“You’re right! I’m the one who wants it! Because I can’t take it anymore! Even now, he’s trying to use the children to control me. Hmph! It’s no use. I’ve been a fool for too long. I’ve had enough!”

I looked up. The sky was filled with clouds of sunset and early stars, but my heart felt heavy. I had feared this day would come — and now it had.

“How are you going to explain this?”

“Let him talk to his mother. Dad — Mom can tell him. And you… you talk to Mom.”

“Great.” A wave of grief welled up. “And the kids? Who will tell them? Xuexue’s too young to understand, but Little Tong knows. He understands everything. You mustn’t hurt him.”

“I know… I…” My sister looked out at the sea and suddenly screamed. I leapt up. In the water, two small bodies were struggling, bobbing up and down. Xiao Yiheng rushed ahead of me, plunged into the sea, and carried them both out — one in each arm. On the sand, Little Tong finally let go of Xuexue’s hand. My sister rushed forward, crying as she held the sobbing girl. I embraced the trembling, soaked Little Tong. They had swallowed a few gulps of seawater but were otherwise unharmed.

But my sister couldn’t stop crying.

“My babies! Mommy’s babies!”

She hugged the little one, stroked the older one.

“How can I ever leave you? How can I ever feel at peace?”

My sister held Xuexue. Xiao Yiheng carried Little Tong on his back. I followed behind, pushing my bicycle, leaving the beach and heading home. The rosy sunset had been devoured by the night, leaving only flickering stars in the dark sky.
