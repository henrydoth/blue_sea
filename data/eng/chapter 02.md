# Chapter Two

Because of what happened to our eldest sister, our second sister Bichou, who teaches in Hong Kong, hurried back home during the summer holidays. She and I went together to speak with my brother-in-law. Bichou still had that gypsy-like air about her, the same carefree smile lingering at the corners of her lips. As soon as she saw him, she got straight to the point:

> “Casanova! So, you're really going through with the divorce, huh?”

My brother-in-law gave a bitter smile and said nothing. I spoke anxiously:

> “It doesn’t have to come to this. It can still be saved!”

> “She’s the one who wants the divorce, not me! Am I supposed to get down on my knees and beg her? I’m a man! What kind of nonsense is that?!”

> “Wow!” Bichou raised her voice. “The great male chauvinist!”

> “Be fair, Bichou! You and little sister know how self-righteous and unreasonable Biying can be!”

> “I don’t want to hear about either of you—” I started to say, but Bichou spoke over me, louder:

> “So it's completely over, isn't it?”

> “She’s the one who filed for divorce! Why don’t you ask her why?” my brother-in-law said angrily.

> “Who filed first isn’t the point!” Bichou shouted back.

> “Enough! What are you two doing?!” I tried to mediate, but it was useless.

They both grew more agitated and veered further off-topic. Bichou had promised me to keep calm, but now my brother-in-law's words had stirred up old wounds from her own painful love life...

> “That’s enough — both of you!” My sharp voice finally cut through their argument. “All you think about is yourselves! Has anyone thought about the children?”

> “According to the law, the children are supposed to stay with me. Biying won’t agree…” my brother-in-law said.

> “The law?” I trembled. “All you two do is fight and argue and snatch things from each other! Have you ever stopped to consider how the kids feel?”

> “They’re still young. They’ll get used to it soon…” his voice was much calmer now.

I leaned back in my chair, exhausted, listening as he told Bichou that he intended to give Biying the newly established Hong Kong branch as compensation.

> “From the moment I met her, I was destined to owe her…” he said, voice heavy and hoarse with emotion.

Mother cried for days. She insisted on going to Taipei, but Father, sighing heavily, wouldn’t let her.

> “If you don’t get involved, how can the problem be solved?” Mother said, wiping her tears.

> “Even if you go, the problem still won’t be solved,” Father sighed again. “Three beloved daughters… harder to raise than thirty sons.”

Bichou and I both lowered our heads in silence.

On the day my sister and brother-in-law signed the divorce papers, I took Little Tong and Xuexue to the children’s amusement park. Xiao Yiheng came along with us. Little Tong and Xuexue had a wonderful time, their laughter ringing out like silver bells.

Looking at Xiao Yiheng, who studied law, I said:

> “It seems the law isn’t really the best way to solve problems.”

He smiled and sat down beside me, his tone relaxed:

> “What about literature then? Is that a better solution?”

I laughed. Quick-witted as always. Though we’d grown up together, the once wild boy had truly changed in recent years.

> “I think love is a better solution,” I said.

He nodded, then added thoughtfully:

> “But aside from love, there has to be something more…”

Isn’t that true? My sister and her husband had enough love, but even so, they had come to this. What were they missing? And what extra something do those couples have — the ones who truly stay together for life?

When the four of us returned to my brother-in-law’s house, the place was still full of guests. Little Tong ran to his grandmother, and the two hugged tightly. Xuexue also rushed over to cling to the elderly woman. My sister had tears in her eyes, and my brother-in-law’s nose was red.

> “It’s done?” I asked softly.

No one responded. My brother-in-law gave a stiff nod. Little Tong, still cheerful, was excitedly telling his grandmother about all the fun they'd had. Then, noticing the heavy expressions around him, he stopped mid-sentence and suddenly asked loudly:

> “Mommy! What’s wrong?”

My sister quickly forced a smile, walked over, and took his hand.

> “Nothing, sweetheart. Mommy’s fine…”

My brother-in-law stepped forward and said to Little Tong:

> “You have to be a good boy, alright? Mommy has to go work in Hong Kong. She won’t be back for a long time…”

Little Tong's eyes widened as he looked at his father, then his mother. His timid voice broke the silence:

> “Mommy…”

My sister suddenly stood up straight, anger in her voice:

> “Why did you tell him? What are you trying to do?!”

> “What’s there to be afraid of?” he yelled back. “If she dares to do it, she should dare to admit it! He was going to find out anyway!”

> “I know…” Little Tong trembled, his face pale, eyes full of fear. Then his voice tore through the room like a scream:

> “You’re getting divorced!”

Father sighed heavily. Mother sobbed. My sister and brother-in-law stood frozen.

Little Tong gasped, choking on tears:

> “You’re… getting divorced…”

> “Little Tong!” my sister grabbed his hand. He looked up at her, pleading:

> “Mom, don’t get divorced…”

> “Little Tong!” my brother-in-law held his shoulder. The boy clung to his father's arm:

> “Dad! Daddy… don’t get divorced…”

> “You’re growing up. You need to listen and understand…” his father said.

Tears streamed down Little Tong’s cheeks. He shook as he begged:

> “I’ll be good! I’ll practice piano! I’ll do my homework before TV! I won’t sneak ice cream! I’ll take care of Xuexue! I’ll get first place in class! Please, don’t get divorced! Please… please…”

He couldn’t think of any other promise to make. He looked desperately between his parents, like a condemned prisoner hoping for a last-minute reprieve. But my sister, through her tears, said:

> “It’s too late, Little Tong.”

And in that instant, the world of a seven-and-a-half-year-old collapsed completely. I could almost hear the sound of his little soul shattering. After a brief pause, he let out a gut-wrenching scream — wild, hysterical, the cry of a dying animal. Xuexue was terrified and burst into tears too. We could only cry with them. No one — not Grandma, not the grandparents, not the aunts — could do anything to piece together Little Tong’s broken world.
