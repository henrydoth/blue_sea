# Chapter Three

For three whole weeks, I couldn’t bring myself to write any more fairy tales for "Little Tong" — because I knew what he truly wanted wasn’t a story.

My eldest and second sisters went to Hong Kong together. Before they left, my eldest sister spoke at length with Little Tong. He no longer cried. His prematurely mature and sorrowful gaze no longer belonged to a child of seven or eight.

"Do you love Mommy?" she asked.

"Yes," he replied quietly.

"Be good, take care of your sister, and protect her well. Understand?"

"Yes." He looked at her and asked earnestly, "If I behave, can I live with Mommy again?"

"Mommy will come back to visit you. When you grow up, then you can live with Mommy."

"Oh…" Little Tong lowered his head, disappointed.

She entrusted him to me. "I’ve always doted on him. He’s the one I worry about most. He’s too smart…"

I nodded and held Little Tong’s hand. "I’ll talk to your dad. Maybe he can let you and Xuexue spend the rest of summer in Danshui before going back to Taipei."

But the former “brother-in-law,” now just “Brother Lü,” didn’t agree. In front of the new nanny, Miss Gao, and the kids, he said, "Without a mother, I have to discipline them strictly. I can’t let them get out of control."

"Brother Lü, don’t you trust me? I am their aunt, after all!" I said with a forced smile to his indifferent face.

He sat down and said, "It’s not that I don’t trust you, but they need to learn piano and painting. I’m raising them with a plan." He smiled confidently. "You’ve heard that kids who learn piano never turn bad, right?"

Standing there, I felt embarrassed and a bit upset. "Are you cutting us off just because of my sister?"

"What are you saying? Little sis!" he raised his eyebrows. "I just want what’s best for the children."

Little Tong stood by Miss Gao, holding Xuexue’s hand. His smile was tight, and his face was tense and somber. I took a deep breath.

"I don’t know whether kids who learn piano will turn bad, but I know that besides piano and painting, they also need care and love — with enough love, a child won’t go bad."

I didn’t dare look at Little Tong. I turned and left the Lü house. The moment I closed the door, tears of frustration and anger rushed down uncontrollably.

A week later, the Lü family’s driver brought Little Tong and Xuexue to Danshui. Brother Lü sent a short note explaining he had to go on a business trip to Hualien and asked us to look after the children for a week. I was overjoyed, hugging and kissing them. Little Tong stood stiffly. But once the driver left, he jumped and laughed, shouting with joy. The whole house lit up with their excitement. Even our parents' frowns faded away. After lunch, Little Tong begged to go to the beach. It looked like it was going to rain, so I hesitated, but just then Xiao Yiheng showed up on his bicycle. So, I took Xuexue, and he took Little Tong, and the four of us rode to the beach.

We laughed and shouted the whole way. Once there, we took off our shoes and socks, rolled in the sand, kicked around, and got our clothes soaked by the waves. Suddenly, thunder clapped, and big raindrops began to fall. Xuexue screamed and jumped into my arms. We scrambled to grab our shoes. Xiao Yiheng carried Little Tong and led us toward a long-abandoned bunker nearby. We ran inside, stepping on soft sand and catching our breath. It was a secret little world, the dim light shutting out the storm. I held quiet little Xuexue close, watching the excitement in Little Tong’s eyes. Then I looked at Xiao Yiheng — he was smiling at me.

"Back then, I was older than Little Tong, and you were even younger than Xuexue. We used to come here and play. Remember?"

A strange echo lingered — remember? Remember?

I nodded with a smile and laid Xuexue’s head on my lap. She seemed tired and lay completely still. Little Tong leaned onto Xiao Yiheng’s back.

"Uncle Xiao! You like my Little Auntie, don’t you?"

Xiao Yiheng pulled him onto his lap and said with a smile, "Little Tong, you really are a smart kid! And do you like your Little Auntie?"

"Of course I do! I practice piano and painting just like I’m told. That’s why Dad let me visit Auntie and Grandpa and Grandma." Little Tong sat beside me and asked, "Little Auntie, can you take me to see Mommy?"

I held him gently and said, "Tonight, let Grandpa call Mommy, and you can talk to her. How’s that?"

"Okay! Actually, I often talk to Mommy when I’m alone. Mommy said she’ll know if I miss her. One night, I missed her so much I dreamed she came and picked up my teddy bear. I shouted for her, but somehow it turned into Daddy. Daddy said I had a nightmare. But I wasn’t dreaming — I really saw Mommy…"

My nose stung, and tears filled my eyes. Xiao Yiheng sat beside him and said in a low voice:

"Little Tong, even if Mommy isn’t here, you have to live well so she won’t worry. My mom passed away when I was very young, but I still grew up, didn’t I? When you grow up, you can do what you want."

Little Tong nodded as if he understood. After a while, he lowered his head and whispered:

"But… I still miss Mommy…"

Xiao Yiheng hugged him tightly, eyes closed in pain. "I know, Little Tong. I know."

I watched them, deeply moved, but powerless…

An hour later, the rain stopped. The sun came out again, and the sea sparkled. Little Tong and Xuexue ran out, jumping happily. Xiao Yiheng said at the bunker’s entrance:

"What you saw at the beach last summer was just a coincidence. I know he became an obstacle. But don’t just believe what you see. I was wrong — I could’ve avoided that coincidence, but I let it happen."

I stood there, stunned, before I could process what he said. He stepped aside, leaving me alone. On the beach, Little Tong and Xuexue were busy collecting shells and holding them to their ears.

"Shells are the sea’s ears!" Little Tong shouted as he ran to Xuexue. "Sis! Let’s talk to Mommy!"

"Hello hello! Mommy—Mommy—" Little Tong called.

"Hello hello! Mommy—Mommy—" Xuexue echoed.

Xiao Yiheng stood tall and suddenly pointed to the sky.

"Look! What’s that?"

We all looked up. A beautiful seven-colored rainbow stretched between sea and sky.

"A bridge!" Xuexue squealed.

"Not a bridge! It’s a rainbow!" Little Tong’s face glowed with reverence.

"Wow! So pretty!"

I looked up at the rainbow — the most beautiful thing that appears after a storm.

Throughout that week, every night, Big Sis called the children. She often broke down crying on the phone. The night before Little Tong was to return home, he asked me to tell him a story. He said he’d already heard all the ones I wrote from his mom.

"Tell a new one," he said.

"Yeah! A new one!" Xuexue chimed in.

"Alright." I thought for a moment. "Auntie will tell you a sea story. Once upon a time, there was a family living by the sea: a dad, a mom, and their son, Laibao…"

"Why is he called Laibao?" Xuexue asked suddenly.

"Because he’s their treasure!" Little Tong answered.

"Exactly!" I continued. "Mom and Dad loved Laibao dearly. Dad was a fisherman who caught big, fat fish. But one year, there were suddenly no fish in the sea. Dad was very sad. Mom was sad too — they had to give a big fish to the king every month. If they failed, the king would have them all executed! Laibao was deeply worried. He was a filial boy — he couldn’t bear to see his parents killed. So, he went to the beach, walking and crying, begging the Dragon King of the Sea to give them a fish."

"Could the Dragon King hear him?" Little Tong asked softly.

"Yes, he could. Didn’t Auntie tell you before that shells are the ears of the sea? They listen for it. So, on the third day, Laibao saw an old man with a white beard. The old man asked why he was crying so sadly. Laibao explained that if they couldn’t catch fish soon, his whole family would be killed. He said, 'I don’t mind dying, but my parents are old, and they’ve worked so hard to raise me. I must save them!' The old man was touched. He told Laibao the Dragon King was heartbroken over the death of his beloved son and didn’t want to give fish to humans anymore. Laibao asked what he could do. The old man asked if Laibao was willing to become the Dragon King’s son. If so, the Dragon King would be happy again and give fish to people. Life as a prince would be wonderful — great food and clothes. But Laibao didn’t want to leave his parents. He preferred a poor life with them. The old man warned that if he refused, his family would die. Laibao thought long and hard, and to save his parents, he agreed to go with the old man. The Dragon King liked Laibao very much and treated him like his own son. Laibao lived a lavish life, but he was never happy…"

"Because he missed his parents," Little Tong interrupted.

"Exactly." I paused, then continued. "His parents caught lots of fish. The king rewarded them with gold. But they weren’t happy either, because they never saw Laibao again. His mom got sick from missing him. The Dragon King took pity and let Laibao visit home. His parents were overjoyed and didn’t want him to leave again. His mom even got better. But the Dragon King also missed him. In the end, the old man came up with a plan — Laibao would live one month under the sea and one month on land. And everyone lived happily."

After the story, Xuexue fell asleep. Moonlight shone through the window, casting peace over her smiling face. I thought: in her dreams, she must have no worries. But Little Tong’s bright eyes stayed wide open. He asked thoughtfully:

"Little Auntie… if someone dies, can they come back to life?"

"I don’t think so," I said with a gentle smile.

"Then… if I die, can I go where I want to go? Can I see who I want to see?"

Startled, I quickly stopped smiling. "Little Tong! Why would you ask that? I don’t know what happens after death. But I do know that the living can’t see the dead."

"That’s okay! The dead grow wings and can fly back home to see their family!"

"But the living will miss them very much. It’ll hurt… a lot."

"Really?" Little Tong asked, his tone dazed.

Suddenly, I felt uneasy. Why was I discussing this with a child? And his expression, his tone — they were unfamiliar, and it frightened me. So, I urged him to sleep. I lay down too, preparing to rest. I don’t know how long passed before I heard him call me. I opened my drowsy eyes, heard the wind, insects, and our old dog Lily’s soft growls — but everything sounded vague.

"Little Auntie, can I not go home tomorrow?"

"No… Miss Gao will come to pick you up early."

A while later, his faint voice whispered:

"Little Auntie, when will I get to see Mommy again?"

"Be a good boy…" I mumbled, exhausted, turned over, and fell into a deep sleep. After that, I heard nothing.
