# Chapter Four

Even though Little Tong had told me more than once that he didn’t like “Miss Gao,” I hadn’t taken it seriously. That is, until over a month later, when I discovered that Miss Gao had been eavesdropping on our phone calls, and even began controlling when Little Tong could speak to us. That was when I had to believe what he had been saying.

At the end of August, Little Tong caught a cold. He secretly tried to call us but was cut off by Miss Gao. He tried three times in a row. I stayed by the phone and listened as each call was abruptly terminated. Finally, when I called back, Miss Gao answered in a flat tone:

> "Little Tong has a cold. The doctor said he needs rest, but he’s being fussy. Miss Luo, please don’t stoop to a child’s level."

But through the receiver, I clearly heard Little Tong’s hoarse, broken cries, screaming "Mama!" over and over. Holding the disconnected receiver, I was overwhelmed by a fury I had never experienced — a rage so strong it felt like it would explode from my chest.

That night, Brother Lü called. I was about to vent, but he jumped in first:

> "I know everything. Little sister, don’t be so childish. Are you still mad?"

I trembled with anger and injustice.

> "You don’t know anything! It’s not about me being upset — I can take it. But Little Tong…"

> "Miss Gao treats Little Tong well. Don’t misunderstand her," he interrupted.

Then he called Little Tong to the phone.

> "Little Auntie! Hello!" his voice was flat, robotic.

> "Little Tong!" I still trembled, full of concern and pain. "How are you feeling now? Any better?"

> "I’m sorry… Little Auntie, it was my fault. I shouldn’t have troubled you. I’ll listen to Daddy from now on. I’ll listen to Miss Gao—"

He spoke like he was reading from a script. Every word stabbed me. My hands trembled.

> "No! Little Tong, it’s not your fault!" I almost shouted, sobbing into the receiver.

But he continued his quiet recitation of repentance:

> "I’ll be a good child, an obedient child."

The phone went back to Brother Lü.

> "Don’t blame Little Tong. It was my fault. He’s a good child."

> "He used to be."

> "He still is!" My voice rose unnaturally.

> "Alright, little sister," he said casually. "You’re still such a child."

After hanging up, I felt worse than before the call. Brother-in-law — Brother Lü — you’re his father! Even if you can’t hear the blood crying inside Little Tong’s heart, can’t you see the pain in your own son’s eyes?

That night, my eldest sister happened to call. I started calmly, asking when she’d come home. But when she said it’d be another month or two, I couldn’t hold back any longer:

> "Are you even a mother? Have you thought about your children at all? Is money the only thing you recognize anymore?!"

Mother snatched the phone away. Father scolded me for my terrible attitude. I wiped my tears and sat silently, listening as Mother reassured Big Sis:

> "Don’t mind her — she’s in a bad mood today. I know… I know… Little Tong is fine. So is Xuexue. Yes… don’t worry… we will, we promise."

Our old dog Lily pushed open the screen door and entered the living room. She was about the same age as Little Tong and had always been his favorite companion. I stroked her shiny brown fur, thinking: if only we could send her to be with Little Tong — how happy he would be…

But when I suggested it the next day, Brother Lü said the apartment building didn’t allow pets. He politely declined.

So, that week’s "For Little Tong" fairy tale was about an old dog with brown fur named “Lily.”

------

One afternoon, about two weeks later, Xiao Yiheng found me at the beach.

> "Little Tong and Xuexue are here!"

I jumped up in surprise. But Xiao Yiheng looked uneasy.

> "They ran away to get here."

> "Ran away?" I couldn’t process it.

> "Little Tong stole some money, took Xuexue, and got on a bus to come here. I happened to run into them on the street and brought them to your house. Uncle Luo called your brother-in-law. He sounded furious."

We rushed home. The mood there was heavy. Xuexue was eating watermelon on the sofa, hair and clothes a mess, but her big eyes still sparkled with innocence. Little Tong was on the phone, with Mother beside him and Father frowning in the corner.

> "Mommy! I don’t want to go back. I really don’t. Mom, can’t you come back? Then… then take me to Hong Kong! I’ll behave… How long will I have to wait? Huh? Until I grow up? But when will I ever grow up? Mom! Mommy! Please don’t cry! I’m sorry! Don’t cry… Okay, I’ll behave… I’ll be good…"

After he hung up, he turned around. No sound came from him, but tears streamed down. Seeing us all watching, his small body trembled more. Mother asked gently:

> "What did Mommy say?"

> "She told me… to go home." His voice was choked.

> "Then… go home," Mother said, struggling with her words.

His eyes scanned all of us. My heart pounded. I couldn’t bear his pleading look. At last, he turned to Xuexue, who had finished her watermelon and had red juice smeared on her face like a pitiful little clown.

> "Sister, come here."

Xuexue obediently went to him. He grabbed her hand. Suddenly, both of them knelt in front of Mother.

> "Grandma! Please let us stay! Please! I don’t want to go back. I promise I’ll be good! I will! I swear!"

They cried together. As Mother and I tried to lift them, Little Tong suddenly bowed down in deep kowtows, banging his forehead against the floor. Xuexue, terrified, let out a sharp scream. Neither Mother nor I could pull him up — he was unbelievably strong.

> "My baby! Please get up! Let’s talk, be good!"

But he couldn’t hear her. He kept slamming his head into the ground. The sound was frightening.

Xiao Yiheng finally picked him up forcibly, struggling against Little Tong’s flailing.

> "Be good, Little Tong! You promised Uncle Xiao—"

Little Tong calmed down. With tear-filled eyes, he looked up at him.

> "But I can’t go home. Daddy will beat me to death. I stole money…"

> "He won’t!" Yiheng and I both said. But my voice was drowned by sobs. Yiheng continued gently:

> "As long as you admit your mistake, and never take his money again… What did you need the money for?"

Little Tong wiped his face.

> "I wanted to buy envelopes and paper… to write letters to Mommy."

> "You could’ve told Daddy. He’d have given you money."

> "No. I couldn’t tell him. Daddy said Mommy doesn’t want us anymore."

I reached out to wipe his tears, only to see my hand trembling unnaturally. Because we hadn’t closed the door, Miss Gao and the driver, Mr. Wang, had already entered the living room. Seeing them, Little Tong’s face turned to terror. He shook his head frantically and began struggling again.

> "I don’t want to go home! I don’t want you!"

Miss Gao signaled Mr. Wang, who stepped forward. Little Tong clung to Yiheng’s neck, and Yiheng gently pried him off while comforting him. As Little Tong finally let go, he let out a desperate, heart-wrenching cry. At the same time, Miss Gao took Xuexue in her arms.

I suddenly heard myself sobbing wildly:

> "Please! I beg you! Don’t… don’t do this!"

In twenty-some years of life, I had never known such devastation — it tore through me like a blade. Pain and helplessness flooded my body.

Yiheng held me. I stood there powerless, hearing Little Tong’s heartbreaking wails. They were already in the courtyard. Lily, tied up, barked madly. Little Tong kept calling out, naming anyone he thought might save him:

> "Grandma! Grandpa! Little Auntie—"

They finally left. I took two steps after them and heard one last, soul-shattering cry:

> "Mom—!"

The car drove off. Lily kept barking. Inside the house, Mother was crying loudly. Father took off his reading glasses to wipe away tears.

> "Such suffering…" he whispered.

And I stood frozen. Once again, despite our love for him, we were completely powerless. Never before had I hated myself more.
