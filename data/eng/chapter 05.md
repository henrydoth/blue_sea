# Chapter Five

I finally couldn't hold back and wrote a letter to my eldest sister — repeating over and over her responsibilities toward her children. The reply wasn’t in her handwriting but in Bichou’s. She said my letter had made my sister so sad she didn’t know how to respond. Bichou wrote:

> "There are many lovers in this world who make grand vows, but few whose love lasts forever. A marriage without love, only pain, is destructive — staying together only leads to harm, not just for the couple but also the children. If divorce can be a new beginning, then perhaps we should at least try, don’t you think? Biwen, I don’t know how you see 'love', but it’s such a fleeting and intangible thing. It comes and goes without warning. When love exists, nothing can stop it; when it’s gone, nothing can bring it back. 'Responsibility' is just an ideal, and sometimes, it comes with cruelty."

That afternoon, I unexpectedly received a letter from a Taipei publishing house. They wanted to select twenty stories from the "For Little Tong" series and publish them as a book. It was an exhilarating afternoon. Xiao Yiheng and I were chatting at the beach.

> “What should I call this book?” I looked at him.

His eyes gazed out at the sea — calm and beautiful, waves lapping softly at the shore.

> “Little Tong loves the sea. Why not choose a name related to the ocean?”

We talked about many things, enveloped by a strange, hazy atmosphere. In his eyes, there was a deep, tender emotion — so intense I almost couldn’t meet his gaze… When did this begin? I instinctively wanted to escape, but also didn’t want to let go.

> “It’s been a long time,” he murmured like in a dream.

> “Back then, when I was a delinquent — broke and shabby — everyone in the village looked down on me. Even childhood friends avoided me like the plague. Only you, with your plain noodles and simple warmth, would always greet me cheerfully: ‘Big Brother Xiao!’ That was the only time I ever felt respected.”

Bichou once said, "In Biwen’s heart, no one is a bad person." Back then, I was too young to believe in evil or hardship. I never imagined I had offered comfort to a wandering soul.

He told me about his past — a mother who died young, a father addicted to gambling and alcohol:

> “After Mom died, I often ran away from home. If I got caught, my father would beat me — whether he lost at gambling, tried to quit, or just got drunk. When he couldn’t drink, he hit even harder. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I left for the city. For more than three years, I did all kinds of bad things — things you could and couldn’t imagine. Then, somehow, I got rich.”

He looked at me, though his eyes were focused far beyond, and continued:

> “I swaggered back home. Just as Dad was about to hit me, I threw money all over the floor. Instantly, his face turned — from fierce to fawning. I no longer needed to run away. I stayed home and bossed people around. But inside, I felt an indescribable sadness — my father loved money more than he loved me.”

He lowered his head, but I had already seen the tears in his eyes.

> “I tried to reconnect with him, but a normal father-son relationship felt like a luxury. I used to be the punching bag; he, the tyrant. Later, I was the rich kid, and he became the groveling servant… The money didn’t last. I slipped away again to avoid falling back into the same pit. He was already sick. Not long after, I went to prison. I was bitter that he never visited me and dreamed of making one last big score, coming home and scattering money again. I didn’t know he had died. He died alone, with no family by his side. And now, I have none either. Only then did I realize — we should have been close, we should have loved each other. But we wasted our entire father-son bond.”

He looked at me, smiling sadly:

> “Biwen, you’re crying.”

Only then did I realize my cheeks were wet. I wiped away the tears quickly.

> “I really didn’t know families like that existed… fathers like that…”

> “They do.” He took a deep breath. “In prison, I heard too many stories. If only more parents would sacrifice a little more for their children’s happiness, there wouldn’t be so much suffering and regret.”

He stood and brushed off the sand, then pulled me up.

> “Yes. I really worry about Little Tong. Just the other day on the phone, he asked me if I didn’t like him anymore.”

> “Did that incident affect him that deeply?”

> “Yes. I thought kids forget easily — but I was wrong. Xuexue caught the mumps and keeps crying for her mom. Little Tong said he’d bring their mother back. He said he’s going to Hong Kong.”

> “He’s too sensitive. He puts too much pressure on himself…” Yiheng said.

We rode our bikes home. Looking at the deep blue sea, an idea struck me.

> “The Sea Is So Blue! How about that for a title?”

> “What?” he asked, puzzled.

> “The book! It’ll be published in time for Little Tong’s eighth birthday. I want to call it *The Sea Is So Blue*. He loves the sea!”

Yiheng nodded.

> “Good! I hope he has a happy birthday.”

The sea breeze filled my clothes, and a quiet joy filled my heart.

Yiheng spent more time with us as he worked on the book’s cover and illustrations before the new school term. That afternoon, the radio reported a typhoon warning. Mother was steaming buns in the kitchen, Father rushed out to buy candles and batteries. Outside, fine drizzle began to fall. Strong winds were expected by nightfall.

Yiheng carried planks and tools, hammering boards to protect the house. I helped him, passing things up and down. On a whim, I picked up a piece of wood and tried nailing it myself. He jumped down from the ladder, rushing over.

> “Miss! You’ll hurt your hand like that—”

Without waiting, he took the hammer from behind me and began hammering. I was surrounded by him. Maybe he didn’t even realize — I told myself not to make a big deal. But I couldn’t move, pressed against his chest, staring at his slender hands — artist’s hands, I thought.

He finished nailing but didn’t step away. He still held me.

> “Brother Xiao… thank you.” I blushed, heart pounding.

But he didn’t move. After a while, he said:

> “You’ve called me ‘Brother Xiao’ enough. We’re grown up now. Time to change that.”

> “Why… why should we?” He could probably hear my heart beating.

> “If we’re willing, a lot of things can change.”

His voice was gentle. Then he put his hands on my shoulders, turned me to face him. His eyes were full of affection.

> “School’s starting, and I have to go back to Taichung. Let me look at you properly, Biwen. Look at me…”

I met his gaze. Suddenly — time, space, the wind, the rain — all stopped. My thoughts stopped too. He didn’t move, and neither did I. That moment, just that moment, was quiet and beautiful.

Then the phone rang. We startled. He reluctantly let go, and I hurried to answer it. It was Brother Lü, sounding tense:

> “Is Little Tong there?”

> “He’s not!” I blurted.

> “Little sister!” His voice was controlled but angry. “He’s been gone for nearly three hours. Don’t lie. Has he arrived yet?”

My mind struggled to catch up.

> “Did you send him? Isn’t someone with him?”

> “He ran away!” he shouted. “Your precious nephew ran away again! He stole money from me and Miss Gao. Said he was going to Hong Kong to find Biying!”

> “What?! No… that’s impossible!”

> “Where else would he go, if not to your place?”

> “Maybe to his grandmother’s?” I grasped for ideas. Another escape.

> “My mother left for the U.S. last month!” he snapped.

Little Tong had once told me on the phone that he’d never come here again. “Because Grandpa, Grandma, and Auntie can’t protect me…”

We love you. We really do want to protect you. But…

> “He really hasn’t come. And he won’t. He doesn’t believe in us anymore.”

> “I know you blame me for not treating him well enough.”

> “You’re his father,” I said, choking back tears. “He doesn’t want toys or clothes or money. He just needs love. A little more love…”

> “I am his father! No one loves him more than I do! We used to be so close. I don’t understand! When Biying left, she took his heart too. I stayed with him, I tried everything — it was useless! Biying’s not here, but she owns his heart! All my efforts were wasted! Why? Why?!”

His voice broke. My chest filled with unspeakable pain.

> “I hired Miss Gao so they wouldn’t suffer from a broken home. I wanted them to adapt quickly and have a normal life. Was I wrong?”

This… this was the father Little Tong needed. He should have told us. He should have told his son.

> “I hit him! But only because I wanted him to forget — to let go of pain and sorrow that weren’t his to carry! Still, I shouldn’t have hit him…”

> “Brother-in-law!” I said, not even realizing I’d called him that again. “Little Tong doesn’t blame you! He might be nearby, afraid to come home! Or… maybe he’ll show up soon. I’ll talk to him. I’ll send him back.”

> “Thank you, little sister. If he shows up, let him stay a few days.”

After I hung up, Mother and Yiheng asked what was going on. I told them. Mother clasped her hands and whispered:

> “Dear heavens, please keep this child safe in this storm!”

Yiheng frowned and looked out the window.

> “He has nowhere else to go. He should come back.”

Outside, the storm grew stronger. I walked to the table. In Yiheng’s drawing, Little Tong smiled up at the sky — so radiant.

Come back, Little Tong. We won’t stand by again, helpless while you cry and beg. Yiheng was right — if we’re willing, we can change things. We can. Just come, Little Tong. Just come—
