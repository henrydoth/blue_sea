# Chapter Six

Half an hour later, Father returned. He had been gone for two hours. As soon as he entered the yard, he called out:

> “Little Tong!”

Yiheng and I rushed to the screen door, both startled.

> “Where’s Little Tong?” we all exclaimed.

> “Ah!” Father stepped into the living room, setting down two large bags. He pulled out some cookies and apples. “I ran into Uncle Xu. He said he saw Little Tong near the alley, so I went and bought his favorite cookies and apples…”

I looked at Mother, then at Yiheng. Their faces had changed — and I’m sure mine had too.

> “That’s impossible! Dad, he didn’t come back,” I said, my throat dry.

Father looked up at us.

> “He didn’t come back? Really?”

He paused, then gave a weak smile.

> “Just kidding! Uncle Xu said Lily was with him too…”

Lily?! I rushed to the screen door. The dog’s leash swung loosely — back and forth, back and forth. Yiheng stepped behind me and said in a low, urgent voice:

> “God… he really came back!”

Little Tong had come back. He took the only friend who never left his side — and we didn’t know! Yiheng didn’t know either. We had seen nothing, heard nothing.

We hoped Little Tong had gone back home with Lily. But night fell, and there was still no sign of him — not at his house, not at ours. Brother Lü arrived with Xuexue. None of us could eat — except for Xuexue. In the storm, Brother Lü drove off with Father and Yiheng to search the town. Mother and I stayed home with Xuexue. Waiting — the most cruel, endless torment.

Little Xuexue asked:

> “Where’s Brother? He said he was going to find Mommy…”

> “Oh heavens…” Mother held her tightly and began to cry. I took Mother’s hand:

> “Don’t worry! He’ll be fine. He must be hiding somewhere, asleep.”

I didn’t cry. I couldn’t cry — because I believed he was safe. He could be mischievous, yes, but also clever and alert. He would be okay.

A loud “bang” — the front door slammed. I leapt up and ran outside. The porch light flickered weakly. The trees in the courtyard swayed violently. I turned away from them… the dog’s leash still swung — up and down, up and down.

> “He’ll be okay!” I smiled at Mother through her tears. “Lily’s with him. He won’t be alone.”

But the storm howled, and they had been gone over two hours.

The radio said the typhoon had changed course and was leaving the island, but the wind and rain still battered on. Finally, they returned — soaked through. Brother Lü’s head was wrapped in bandages, and Yiheng’s face was bruised. Father exclaimed:

> “The car crashed into a power pole! Brother Lü’s head was bleeding. We went to the clinic before coming back.”

Brother Lü’s face was pale as he turned to Mother:

> “We couldn’t find him, Mom. We couldn’t…”

> “We will!” Mother stroked his hair like she would Little Tong’s. “We’ll find him.”

That night, a call came from Biying.

> “I want to talk to Little Tong.”

> “He’s not here!” I panicked.

> “I just called earlier. They said all three — father and kids — are at your place.”

I froze. Such bad timing. But I couldn’t tell her!

> “They were here, but the typhoon came, you know, wind and rain…”

> “I know about the typhoon. I just want to talk to him. I miss him…”

> “Big Sis!” I stalled, then blurted, “He… he caught the mumps from Xuexue. He’s sleeping, can’t talk.”

> “He did? But he had mumps when he was little…” Oh no.

> “I’m not sure. We’ll take him to the doctor tomorrow, okay?”

> “Little Sis, I’m just worried about him. Please take good care of him and Xuexue. I’ll be back next week!”

Next week. Why not now?

Suddenly, the power went out. Sleepy Xuexue began to cry. Mother gave me a candle and told me to take her to bed. As she drifted off, she murmured:

> “Little Auntie, when is Brother coming back?”

> “Sleep, sweetheart. He’ll be back soon…”

I sat by the bed, staring at the candle. Wind and rain lashed outside. In the living room, whispers drifted. Exhaustion crept in. I slowly closed my eyes, not sleeping, just listening: rustling leaves, Father’s sighs, low voices between Mother and Brother Lü…

Then a voice: “Little Auntie!”

I frowned but didn’t open my eyes.

Again: “Little Auntie!”

It was Little Tong! I opened my eyes. He stood by the window, eyes shining.

> “Little Tong!” I leapt up and hugged him. Thank God — he was safe!

> “Where were you?! You scared us to death!”

He smiled gently.

> “I came to see my sister… and Little Auntie. I promised her I’d bring Mommy back.”

He turned to me excitedly:

> “I can already see Mommy now, just like Laibao. I see Mommy… and you too.”

A chill ran through me. I grabbed his hand — it was ice cold.

> “What did you say? Who’s Laibao?”

The name was familiar, but I couldn’t recall why. His words were strange. His hand, freezing. His smile, distant.

> “Little Auntie!” he looked up at me. “I have to go.”

> “No! Little Tong!” I held his hand tighter. “You’re cold?”

He nodded.

> “My clothes and shoes are wet… so cold…”

I walked to the closet.

> “I’ll get you some dry clothes. Then you won’t be cold.”

I fumbled in the candlelight. His voice, faint:

> “I’m leaving now…”

> “Be good, change first…”

I turned — and my blood ran cold. Little Tong was gone. Gone! I bolted upright, drenched in cold sweat. I was in bed. Xuexue was asleep beside me.

Just a dream. Only a dream.

Mother entered quietly. I asked:

> “Where’s Little Tong?”

She shook her head, face full of sorrow.

As dawn broke, the storm lessened. Father and Brother Lü went out to search again. Mother brought out medicine. I took over treating Yiheng’s bruised face. As I turned, I saw Little Tong’s portrait — his smiling face. My heart seized. The cotton ball fell from my hand.

Suddenly, I remembered the story of Laibao and the Dragon King. Little Tong had said:

> “I can already see Mommy, just like Laibao!”

I wiped Yiheng’s bruise. Slowly, it all made sense. This… was an exchange?

No. It couldn’t be. It mustn’t be!

Yiheng grasped my trembling hand. Tears fell uncontrollably.

> “I’m fine,” he said.

> “Don’t worry, Biwen. We’ll find him. He’ll come back!”

I covered my face and wept. Oh God, let him come back. If there must be an exchange, don’t let it be Little Tong. Please, not him!

As dawn brightened, the rain stopped, but the wind still howled. Mother made rice porridge. Everyone ate — except Brother Lü. He sat alone, devastated. I brought a bowl to him.

> “Eat something.”

He shook his head, staring at the floor.

> “Not eating won’t help,” I said urgently.

> “I shouldn’t have hit him…” he whispered. “Mistake after mistake…”

> “Brother-in-law!” I said. “This isn’t your fault!”

> “It is. I didn’t really hate Biying, or stop loving her. It’s just…” he covered his face.

> “I know,” I said. And I truly did.

Suddenly, we heard it — a bark. Lily! Joy flashed across everyone’s face. We ran to the courtyard. Lily, soaking wet, crouched in the yard, whimpering.

> “Little Tong!” I shouted, running outside.

> “Little Tong!” Brother Lü called, scanning the yard.

> “Little Tong! Little Tong!” we all cried out.

Lily whimpered, head down. I knelt beside her, shouting:

> “Lily! Where is he?! Where did you go?! Tell us!”

Yiheng knelt and checked her.

> “She’s bleeding. She’s hurt!”

Her hind leg bled. Dried blood and sand clung to her fur. Sand…?!

A realization struck me.

> “The beach! He’s at the beach!”

We ran to the beach. The bunker came into view. The sea had washed up the sand — soft and wet. I couldn’t run fast, but my thoughts raced.

Let him be there. In the bunker. Shells are the sea’s ears… Oh God, save him! He’s done no wrong. Please! He’s just a child.

> “When can I see Mommy?” Oh Little Tong, Mommy will be back next week!

> “Can parents remarry after divorcing?” Yes, Little Tong! As long as you’re safe, anything is possible!

> “I’m cold… my clothes and shoes are wet…” I brought you dry clothes! We’re all here! You won’t be cold anymore! We all love you!

We’re all here, Little Tong. Come home with us—

I stepped into the bunker. In an instant, all thought was vacuumed away — the bunker was empty. Nothing.

Soon, people crowded the beach — police, soldiers, strangers. I sat inside the bunker, empty and hopeless. Yiheng helped Brother Lü in. His face was pale, filled with fear.

Yiheng turned to go. I grabbed him in desperation.

> “You have to save him! Promise me!”

> “Biwen…” he comforted me.

> “Promise me!” I shook him. Tears streamed. He clenched his jaw and looked to the sky.

> “I’ll bring him back. I swear!”

He left. I sat there, comforted only by his weak promise. They’ll save him. He’s not even eight. So smart, so kind. Tongyun, Ruixue — such precious siblings. Who could harm them…?

> “Found him! He’s here!”

Cries erupted from the beach. I rushed out. Blinding sunlight made me dizzy. But I saw — I saw Little Tong, lying on the beach, surrounded by strangers shaking their heads, sighing.

> “Little Tong!” I screamed, clutching the clothes. His clothes and shoes were soaked. He was cold. Auntie brought you dry clothes. Let’s go home—

Someone blocked me. It was Yiheng.

> “Don’t look, Biwen.”

> “I want Little Tong!” I said, trembling. He said nothing, just shook his head.

> “It’s too late… he’s gone.”

I heard Brother Lü’s soul-crushing wail:

> “Little Tong! Little Tong!”

He held his son tightly, kissing him again and again. I stepped forward, but Yiheng stopped me.

> “You promised me—” I shouted. “You said you’d bring him back!”

I pushed him, screaming:

> “Little Tong! Auntie’s here! I’m here—”

His clothes fell to the sand. I didn’t care. He lay in his father’s arms, no longer cold.

> “Little Auntie, if someone dies, can they come back?”

> “If I die, can I go where I want? See who I want?”

Oh, Little Tong! I collapsed on the sand, reaching out — but I couldn’t reach him. I struggled forward. Then suddenly, the whole beach came crashing down around me. No time to scream. I lost consciousness.
