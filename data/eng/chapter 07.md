# Chapter Seven

We buried Little Tong — a small coffin, a small grave. On the gravestone, Little Tong was smiling brightly. He had finally seen the people he longed for: Grandpa, Grandma, his little sister, his father… and his mother, too.

As we were leaving, Xuexue suddenly asked:

> “Why is Brother sleeping there by himself? Why isn’t he coming home with us?”

No one answered. Everyone just wiped their tears. Xuexue slipped out of Big Sis’s grasp.

> “I want to stay with Brother! He stayed with me when I was sick, when I was sleeping…”

> “Xuexue!” Big Sis broke down again. “Please! Don’t say that, don’t…”

I held onto Xuexue. Her big eyes were filled with tears.

> “Be good, Xuexue…” I picked her up. She clung to my neck.

> “Brother will come home to stay with you. He’s a little angel now, with wings. He can fly to your bedside. You can’t see him, but he can see you. So you have to be good, and listen…”

> “Really? Little Auntie?” she asked, eyes searching mine.

That’s what Little Tong said. That’s what he said…

> “It’s true,” I said, kissing her moist cheek.

Big Sis didn’t return to Hong Kong. She stayed by Xuexue’s side, never leaving. Brother Lü stopped working, too. He stayed with Little Tong’s photo from morning till night.

In autumn, Brother Lü decided to spend some time in the United States. He handed the company business over to Big Sis. She was going to see him off at the airport.

> “It’s inconvenient to bring Xuexue. Let her stay,” I said.

> “No!” Big Sis held Xuexue tightly. “We’re going together. We won’t be separated again!”

Xuexue clutched a newly picked pomelo, nestled against her mother, accompanied by her father —

Little Tong! Was this the exchange you made? Is this what you wanted, child? Are you satisfied?

The November sun was still brilliant. I sat beside the bunker, the newly published book on my lap. A blue cover. Little Tong’s beaming smile.

Bold red letters — *The Sea Is So Blue!*

Xiao Yiheng came running toward me. Was it another holiday? He saw me and frowned:

> “Biwen, you’re still like this?!”

> “Leave me be! Let me stay this way. Don’t say anything…” I covered my face with the book, avoiding his gaze.

He snatched the book away, visibly agitated:

> “Little Tong is gone! But you can’t let this control your entire life! You have to love again! Get married! Have children — are you going to hide from life forever?”

> “What is love?” I shouted. “What’s marriage? What does having children guarantee? Look at the world — how many Little Tongs are out there? How many Xuexues? Who takes responsibility? Who?!”

He said nothing. I sneered:

> “Did the law tell us who should die? Was it Little Tong?”

> “Of course it shouldn’t have been him!” he exploded.

> “The law tries to fix problems, but people keep making them — selfishness, suspicion, arrogance, prejudice, ignorance…” His voice softened.

> “The law isn’t omnipotent, Biwen. You need love. With enough trust and tolerance, these things wouldn’t happen.”

He handed the book back to me. I took it. Little Tong was still smiling — joyfully, contentedly.

> “I used to wait for you to grow up,” Yiheng said gently, eyes full of earnestness. “Now, I’ll wait for you to believe.”

He smiled, patted my shoulder, and walked away. I wanted to call after him, but couldn’t. I just watched his figure fade into the white distance…
